# Python Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge 

These two sets of projects helped me understand Python coding, giving me a chance to turn my initial coding into something tangible using GitBash as my dashboard and Visual Studio Code as my coding space.

## Description

In this assignment, I used the concepts I learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. Both tasks present a real-world situation where my newly developed Python scripting skills came in handy.

## pybank

PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The analysis should align with the following results:

## pypoll

PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

### Dependencies

* Must have GitBash used as an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience noting commands for analysis

* Must have Visual Studio Code 

### Installing

* Download the VBA raw data and copy and paste it while in VBA Developer mode in Excel. 
* No modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### VBA Code

## Help

No issues as it runs well on Microsoft Excel. Do recommend erasing the updated data to check the code every time.
